# HiC_MCMC
Orientation of contigs using Hi-C data

## Purpose of the project
Existing scaffolding algorithms using Hi-C data is good in finding orders of contigs. However, this builds contain sufficient numbers of errors at orientations. We apply probability model for resolving this problem.

## Main ideas:



## Dependencies:
* Python 3.7
Python dependencies can be installed with pip:
 
 `
 pip install -r requirements.txt
